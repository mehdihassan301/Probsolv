    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      In the heart of Pakistan, surrounded by everyday struggles ‚Äî broken systems, outdated processes, and underserved communities ‚Äî ProbSolv was born. Not in a tech hub, but in a town where real people face real problems. One young dreamer saw those problems, not as obstacles, but as opportunities to change lives using technology.
    </p>
    <p>
      From school students needing AI guidance,  from shopkeepers trying to sell online, to job-winning CV designed with your personal strengths, skills, and achievements.‚Äî ProbSolv exists for them. With a heart rooted in empathy and a mind built on innovation, we craft smart, affordable solutions that matter.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      To democratize technology and make AI-powered tools available to every student, shopkeeper, and family in Pakistan ‚Äî especially in areas where digital access and understanding is limited. We aim to lead the 21st-century shift by:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>üìö Educating youth about AI and digital tools in native languages</li>
      <li>üõç Helping businesses go online using WhatsApp and QR</li>
      <li>üìπ job-winning CV designed with - personal strengths, skills, and achievements.</li>
    <ul>
